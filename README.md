# Starship repo

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is awesome, and it lacks Debian/Ubuntu packages. This repo maintains an APT repository packaging the upstream builds.

## Usage

TODO

## Building

```console
mkdir work
cd work
../package 1.6.3
```

You'll then find `*.deb` files for each supported architecture.
